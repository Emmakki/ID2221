- Process to do on data:

### 1. **Analysis of Species Geographic Distribution**
   - [ ] **Mapping spatial distribution**: Visualizing the geographic distribution of species at different scales (global, regional, or local) is one of the main applications of OBIS data. This can include heat maps, observation point distributions, or biodiversity zoning.
   - [x] **Identification of biodiversity hotspots**: By identifying regions with a high concentration of species, we can better understand local biodiversity and determine ecologically important areas.

### 2. **Temporal Studies (Changes Over Time)**
   - [ ] **Temporal trend analysis**: Observe changes in species distribution over several decades or analyze seasonal and interannual variations.
   - [x] **Migratory phenomena**: Identify changes in species distribution due to climate variations (such as migration to colder regions as a result of ocean warming).

### 3. **Biodiversity and Species Richness Analysis**
   - [ ] **Species richness calculation**: Use the data to calculate species richness in different regions or at various depths to compare zones.
   - [ ] **Biodiversity indices**: Calculate indices like Shannon or Simpson to estimate species diversity in specific areas.

### 4. **Habitat and Ecological Niche Modeling**
   - [ ] **Ecological niche models**: OBIS data can be combined with environmental variables (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.) to model the ecological niche of species, helping to understand the conditions under which a species is likely to live.
   - [ ] **Predictive species distribution modeling**: Use Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict where species might occur based on different environmental or climate scenarios.

### 5. **Habitat Connectivity Analysis**
   - [ ] **Ecological connectivity study**: Understand how different populations of the same species are connected geographically, which can be essential for fish stock management or the conservation of endangered species.

### 6. **Identification of Threatened or Invasive Species**
   - [ ] **Threatened species analysis**: Identify marine species that are endangered or vulnerable based on available observation data.
   - [ ] **Monitoring invasive species**: Track the appearance of non-native species in certain ecosystems and follow their spread.

### 7. **Data Gaps and Data Quality Analysis**
   - [ ] **Evaluation of data coverage**: Analyze geographic areas or time periods lacking data to identify gaps in species monitoring or sampling.
   - [ ] **Data quality checks**: Monitor geographic, taxonomic, or temporal biases in the data.

### 8. **Marine Conservation Applications**
   - [ ] **Conservation planning**: By combining OBIS data with other environmental datasets, researchers can identify potential marine protected areas or assess the effectiveness of existing ones.
   - [ ] **Monitoring climate change effects**: Analyze the impact of ocean warming and acidification on species distribution.

### 9. **Species-Environment Interaction Detection**
   - [ ] **Biotic and abiotic interaction analysis**: Explore how specific species interact with their environment and other species. For example, observe predator-prey relationships, associations with specific habitats (such as coral reefs), or dependence on certain environmental conditions.

### 10. **Species Rarity Analysis**
   - [ ] **Estimation of rare species**: Determine which species are observed very infrequently in OBIS data and understand why they may be so rare in certain regions (poor sampling, actual rarity, etc.).

### 11. **Detection of Distribution Range Shifts Due to Climate Change**
   - [ ] Using historical OBIS data, it is possible to observe if species have shifted their distribution range in response to rising ocean temperatures or other climatic factors.
