- Install HDFS localhost

- Install Spark

- Store OBIS csv in HDFS

- Creation MongoDB cluster to store results

- Process to do on data:

   - [x] **Identification of biodiversity hotspots**: By identifying regions with a high concentration of species, we can better understand local biodiversity and determine ecologically important areas.

   - [x] **Migratory phenomena**: Identify changes in species distribution due to climate variations (such as migration to colder regions as a result of ocean warming).

   - [x] **Biodiversity indices**: Calculate indices like Shannon or Simpson to estimate species diversity in specific areas.

   - [x] **Evaluation of data coverage**: Analyze geographic areas or time periods lacking data to identify gaps in species monitoring or sampling.

   - [ ] **Monitoring climate change effects**: Analyze the impact of ocean warming and acidification on species distribution.

   - [ ] **Estimation of rare species**: Determine which species are observed very infrequently in OBIS data and understand why they may be so rare in certain regions (poor sampling, actual rarity, etc.).
