    <h1>Analyzing Ocean Biodiversity Data</h1>

      Climate change is driving significant shifts in ocean conditions, including rising temperatures, acidification, and
      altered currents, which impact marine biodiversity and species distribution. Using the Ocean Biodiversity Information 
      System (OBIS) dataset, this project aims to analyze these changes, uncover patterns in marine biodiversity,
      and assess the ecological effects of climate-driven ocean shifts. Understanding these dynamics is essential for 
      predicting biodiversity trends and guiding conservation and climate adaptation strategies.
