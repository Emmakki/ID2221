## Task 2 - Project Assignment

*For this task, you must define your project by writing a one-page description and obtaining approval for your project proposal from the examiner. Your project proposal should include the following sections:*

    Problem Description: What problem will you be investigating?
    Tools: Which tools will you use? While Spark is the primary tool covered in this course, you are encouraged to explore additional tools and technologies. It is mandatory to read data from a big data storage system (e.g., HDFS, HBase, etc.) and use Spark (its core or any of its modules) as the processing unit. The project output can be presented using a visualization tool or stored in a NoSQL database.
    Data: What data will you use, and how will you collect it?
    Methodology and Algorithm: What method(s) or algorithm(s) do you propose to use?

*You can implement your code either in Jupyter Notebook or as a stand-alone application. The final submission should include a zip file containing your code and a short report (2-3 pages) detailing what you have done, the dataset used, your methodology, your results, and instructions on how to run the code.*

## Task 3 - Group Presentation

*In this, each group will select one of the course modules and work on it by writing an essay and presenting it to an opponent group (another group). The reading material for each module is available here.*

*This task consists of several steps:*

    Step 1: Each group should select a module and study the relevant material.
    Step 2: Each group member should individually focus on a subtopic, prepare a presentation, and present it to the other group members.
    Step 3: The group should collaboratively write an essay to explain their findings and prepare a presentation based on the essay.
    Step 4: Each group should study the essay of another group and prepare some questions for a critique (at least five questions). The list of questions should be sent to the examiner before the oral presentation.
    Step 5: Each group should present their findings and respond to questions from their opponent group.

*Grading for this task is divided into the following components:*

    E: Essay - group grade (5 points)
    P: Presentation and interaction - group grade (2 points)
    Q: Reviewing the essay and preparing the questions - group grade (2 points)
    A: Answering questions - individual grade (1 point)
